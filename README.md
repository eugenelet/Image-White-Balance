Image Transformation based on HSI 
=================================

This is an example of white balancing an image.

The containing executable file is compiled for x86 architecture under Linux.

I've used OpenCV for reading and writing bmp files in this work, so any version of OpenCV will do since they share the same function for reading and writing files. (I'm using version 2.14.3) 

To compile
> **make** 

To run the executable
> **./[executable file name] [input file]**

Demo
----
**Input**
![Alt text](input1.bmp?raw=true "Input Image")
**Output**
![Alt text](wb.bmp?raw=true "Output Image")
